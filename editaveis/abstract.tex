\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

    Currently there is a large market demand for the implementation
    of DevOps in organizations as part of the competitive advantage
    strategy. The DevOps culture brings concepts and practices aimed at increasing
    the amount of software delivered in a short period of time with higher quality
    and safety. The Chef tool, one of the most popular automation tools within the
    context of DevOps is a facilitator for infrastructure orchestration, applying
    the concept of IaC (Infrastructure as Code). This work shows the implementation
    of the tool, called Cupper, that reads a previously configured system environment
    and outputs a script, in the Chef standard, for replicating this environment
    on another machine. The version of the tool at the end of this work is v0.2.1 and
    is avaliable on \url{https://github.com/cupper-reverse-recipe/cupper}.
